# Blender version
This addon must be used with version 2.7x  
This feature is included by default on 2.8x, with **Ctrl+Tab** shorcut, so this addon is useless with 2.8x

# Switch Anim View

Switch between GraphEditor and DopeSheet with Z  
Based on an idea from Hjalti Hjalmarsson.  
(and seems to be also included into [Amaranth Addon](http://pablovazquez.org/amaranth/)).
